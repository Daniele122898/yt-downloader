# Why?
This is just a quick and dirty implementation I wrote for my own use. I dislike all the available sites since they are usually completely full of intrusive ads and convert to low bitrates.

Thus i created my own version. Of course with no ads and highest possible bitrates. It's sleek, modern and most importantly small and light weight. It is also designed to be mobile friendly.

# What can it do?
It can convert to mp3 and mp4 formats. It supports renaming of the file as well as metadata. So you can specify your custom title as well as the artist(s) involved.

You can also specify the resolution if you want to convert to mp4.

# Hosting
I'm pretty sure that this is not generally endorsed by YouTube and thus I will not provide any publicly hosted version of this. If you need this you will have to host it yourself. Bear in mind that the conversion of mp4 files is really taxing on the CPU and will benefit from high core count and speed.
